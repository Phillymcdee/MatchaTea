# MatchaTea

This was a part of a Rotman Analytics MBA case competition.
Though it was originally completed in SAS, I built on my analyis using Python.

The goal of the competition was to determine whether a specific loyalty campaign was successful. 
I developped relavent KPI's and determined the campaign's ROI.
I also conducted an RFM analysis of all loyalty members based on their transaction history 
and designed and built a tableau dashboard to better manage loyalty segements in future campaigns. 

Unfortunately, due to an NDA, I cannot share the data or analysis however, you can find my Tableau 
dashboard here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/philippe.mcdonald#!/
